# Smart Brains
[Smart Brain](https://smart-brains-0.herokuapp.com/) is full stack app with Client side created using `REACT JS` which you can find [here](https://github.com/shehroze-1122/smart-brains-frontend) and Server side is powered using node js and I used Postgresql serving as a database. This application
is fully optimized with security being handled carefully.

The app has a Sign In and Register form as you open the link to it, where you can register if you haven't already and then it welcomes the user with a cool UI and takes care of the UX too. Users can enter the url of any image containing any number of humans. 
Then the magic happens and the SMART BRAIN will create red boxes around every face in the image.
The app hits clarifai api with your entered image URL and then responds with the coordinates for the bounding boxes which we then tackle to create the actual boxes on the image.


This repository is dedicated to the server side.
Feel free to point to any issues or contribute to it.
